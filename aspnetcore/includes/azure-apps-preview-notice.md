> **ASP.NET Core 3.0 with Azure App Service**
>
> ASP.NET Core 3.0 has not yet been deployed to Azure App Service. We hope to provide ASP.NET Core 3 on Azure App Service soon. To host an app that uses an ASP.NET Core 3.0:

* Treat ASP.NET Core 3.0 like a preview release for Azure App Service deployment.
* See [Deploy ASP.NET Core preview release to Azure App Service](xref:host-and-deploy/azure-apps/index#deploy-aspnet-core-preview-release-to-azure-app-service).
